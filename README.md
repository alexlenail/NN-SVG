NN-SVG
======

What's conventionally described as the trellis structure of the connections between two
fully-connected layers of a neural network is really a visual description of a matrix-vector product.
Driven by the belief that mathematics are beautiful when properly represented,
I'm building a little tool to quickly generate SVG representations of these trellises,
to visualize classic fully-connected neural networks, on top of d3.


In the future I'd like to have three layouts:
- [x] Conventional FCNN layout
- [x] [LeNet CNN layout](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lenet_architecture.png)
- [x] [AlexNet layout](http://www.mdpi.com/remotesensing/remotesensing-09-00848/article_deploy/html/images/remotesensing-09-00848-g001.png) (via webGL)
